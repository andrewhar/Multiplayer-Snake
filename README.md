# Game Rules

Snake is a popular game that originated in late 1970s. Since then, it has been widely played across different platforms with a common set of rules. We will be adapting most of the rules from the original game since everyone is familiar to the original rules. The rules that our version of the game will have are:
* Players will have options to move their snake either up, down, left, right or no move at all. No move will mean that the snake will continue to proceed in the same direction as the last move.
* To score points, players need to pick up/eat a fruit that will appear in random places all over the board. There will be only one fruit at a time. Once a fruit is picked up, another one will pop up in a random place. After eating a fruit, the snakeâ€™s length will slightly increase.
* There are several ways for a player to die in the game. 
	* Firstly, the player can die if the snake hits a wall on any one of the four edges on the board. 
	* Another way of dying is when one snake hits another snake or hits itself. No snake can cross-over another snake in the game.
	* If two snakes collide head on, then both snakes will be eliminated just to make it fair for both the players.
* Like any other game, the main aim for a player is to win the game. In this game, the winner will be the last player surviving with his/her snake on the board.
